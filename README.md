# Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page

* Build an app (instructions specify CodePen.io, I am using VS Code) that is similar to [this example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL).

## Must meet the following User Stories:

1.	User Story #1: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

2.	User Story #2: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

3.	User Story #3: Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

4.	User Story #4: I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

5.	User Story #5: When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

6.	I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

7.	User Story #7: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

8.	User Story #8: Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

9.  User Story #9: The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

10. User Story #10: The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

11. User Story #11: Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

12. User Story #12: When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

13. User Story #13: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

14. User Story #14: My product landing page should have at least one media query.

15. User Story #15: My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

* Test the app with the following CDN (Content Deliver Network) [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js)

### Lessons Learned

* Passed with 16/16 in codepen. Chrome/Firefox security features prevented the test script from recognizing everything and passed a 14/16
* I need to spend more time learning about @media queries and the appropriate values for certain device classes (i.e. tablet, phone, etc)
* I styled using mostly IDs when I should have been using classes
* Experimented with animating the Navbar, happy with how it turned out
* From a design standpoint; need a smaller logo (or the text needs to be to the right) in the Navbar.  Need to add more products to the featured section
* Need to research on how to make grid item layout standard, rather than assign each individual li to a column/row
